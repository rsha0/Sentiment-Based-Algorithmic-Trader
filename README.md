# Sentiment Based Algorithmic Trading

This project selects a stocks from the S&P500 index and filters them by public sentiment towards them. Following this, 3 different trading strategies are tested against these stocks: breakout, long bias and momentum strategies. To visualise the returns, there is a function which can plot out line curves for each strategy. 

The strategy which provides the highest return along with the strategy which has the lowest risk are both returned to the user.
